This program is an example of following a quick tutorial to work with AWS within the AWS service known as S3.

The majority of the functionality of this program was provided by AWS and copied for learning purposes. Some additional
functionality was added by the developer to demo further AWS functionality - namely deleteing the bucket.

The Tutorial can be found [AWS Tutorial - Simple Cross Platform Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/quick-start-s3-1-cross.html).

Additional functionality was discovered in [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet1/latest/apidocs/html/N_Amazon_S3.htm) documentation.
